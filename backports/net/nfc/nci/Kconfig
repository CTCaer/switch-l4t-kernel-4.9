	  NCI (NFC Controller Interface) is a communication protocol between
	  an BACKPORT_NFC Controller (NFCC) and a Device Host (DH).

	  Say Y here to compile NCI support into the kernel or say M to
	  compile it as module (nci).

	  NCI (NFC Controller Interface) is a communication protocol between
	  an BACKPORT_NFC Controller (NFCC) and a Device Host (DH).

	  Say yes if you use an NCI driver that requires SPI link layer.
