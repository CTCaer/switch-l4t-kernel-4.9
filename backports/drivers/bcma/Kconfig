	  BACKPORT_BCMA bus may have many versions of PCIe core. This driver
	  supports:
	  1) PCIe core working in clientmode
	  2) PCIe Gen 2 clientmode core

	  In general PCIe (Gen 2) clientmode core is required on PCIe
	  hosted buses. It's responsible for initialization and basic
	  hardware management.
	  This driver is also prerequisite for a hostmode PCIe core
	  support.
