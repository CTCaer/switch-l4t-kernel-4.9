        A driver 802.11b wireless cards based on the Atmel fast-vnet
        chips. This driver supports standard Linux wireless extensions.

        Many  cards based on this chipset do not have flash memory
        and need their firmware loaded at start-up. If yours is
        one of these, you will need to provide a firmware image
        to be loaded into the card by the driver. The Atmel
        firmware package can be downloaded from
        <http://www.thekelleys.org.uk/atmel>
