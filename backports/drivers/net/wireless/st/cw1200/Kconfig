	  This is a driver for the ST-E CW1100 & CW1200 BACKPORT_WLAN chipsets.
	  This option just enables the driver core, see below for
	  specific bus support.

	  Enable support for the BACKPORT_CW1200 connected via an SDIO bus.
	  By default this driver only supports the Sagrad SG901-1091/1098 EVK
	  and similar designs that utilize a hardware reset circuit. To
	  support different BACKPORT_CW1200 SDIO designs you will need to override
	  the default platform data by calling cw1200_sdio_set_platform_data()
	  in your board setup file.

config BACKPORT_CW1200_WLAN_SPI
	tristate "Support SPI platforms"
	depends on !CW1200_WLAN_SPI
	depends on BACKPORT_CW1200 && SPI
	help
	  Enables support for the BACKPORT_CW1200 connected via a SPI bus.  You will
	  need to add appropriate platform data glue in your board setup
	  file.
